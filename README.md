# Creating A Database Architect

## Users

We need a number of things from users.
Their email, password and username(optional?).

We could also get their First and Last names. In order to personalize some information (maybe we need to send an email or something.)

## Users Table

| Columns   | Field Type | Comment |
| --------- | ---------- | ------- |
| email     | varchar    |         |
| password  | varchar    | Hashed  |
| username  | varchar    |         |
| firstName | varchar    |         |
| lastName  | varchar    |         |
